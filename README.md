## How it works
FileDock is a vertical dock in the left side of screen. Normally, FileDock is closed, for open the dock you just over mouse on it.
When FileDock is opened for the first time, you can see three buttons:
  - Add button: Use to open a new folder and add to the dock.
  - Switch side button: Use to switch the side from right to left and vice versa.
  - Close button: just close FileDock.

You can add at most 8 folder on the dock, if you add another one, the useless folder will be switched with the new one.

### Who is the useless folder?
For determinate who is the useless folder, it use the [frecency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency) heuristic.
