## How it works
FileDock is a vertical dock in the left side of screen. Normally, FileDock is closed, for open the dock you just over mouse on it.
When FileDock is opened for the first time, you can see two buttons:
  - AddButton: Use to open a new folder and add to the dock.
  - CloseButton: just close FileDock.

You can add at most 8 folder on the dock, if you add another one, the useless folder will be switched with the new one.

### Who is the useless folder?
For determinate who is the useless folder, it use the [frecency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency) heuristic.
